# High-Speed Rail

Do you think Ice Boats are dumb?  Do you wish minecarts were a viable form of transportation?  Then this is the mod for you!

Just build your rails on gravel blocks and your minecarts will go the same speed as ice boats.

## Features

* **Fast Minecarts.**  Why settle for 8 blocks-per-second?  Go 40, 50, 60 bps or more!
* **Fully customizable.**  Configure different speed boosts for different blocks.
* **No derailing.** Minecarts automatically reduce to normal speed on curves.
* **Serverside-only.**  Clients do not need to install the mod.
* **Vanilla-friendly.**  Does not add new blocks to your world.

## Bonus Features

* Minecart speedometer
* Nerf for ice boats (boats on ice move the same as on land)


## Notes

* The speed-up does not work on *any* curved tracks, including 'diagonal' sections.
* Top speed is increased but not acceleration.  Use more powered rails to go faster.
* Speed is capped at 78 blocks-per-minute.
* The speedometer and ice boat nerf can be turned off in the config file.
* I will not be doing a Forge port of High-Speed Rail.


## Credits

* High-Speed Rail was inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/czljdy/minecart_speed_increases_when_gravel_is_put_under/)
* And also [Gravel Carts](https://modrinth.com/mod/gravel_carts) which is great mod that implements the same idea a bit differently
* Idea for disabling ice boats borrowed from [Ice Boat Nerf](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ice-boat-nerf)
* Idea for speedometer borrowed from [Speedometer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/speedometer)
